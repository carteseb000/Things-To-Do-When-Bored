    <h2>What is photogrammetry?</h2>
    <p>For centuries, photogrammetry has played a vital role in our understanding of distant objects and the earth's surface. Its uses have expanded over the years, giving rise to a powerful range of innovative technologies in industries such as construction, engineering, medicine and many others.</p>
    <p>Photogrammetry collects measurements and data on an object by analyzing the change in position of two different images. It uses things like perspective, advanced processing software, and photo analysis to get the job done, but it can happen on the ground or from above. In this guide we will explain the different types of photogrammetry and how it can be used.</p>
