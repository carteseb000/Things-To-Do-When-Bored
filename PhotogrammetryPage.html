    <h2>What is photogrammetry?</h2>
    <p>Photogrammetry, as the name suggests, is a three-dimensional coordinate measurement technique that uses photographs as the basic means of metrology or measurement. The fundamental principle used in photogrammetry is triangulation. By taking photos from at least two different locations, so-called "lines of sight" can be developed from each camera to points on the object. These lines of sight, sometimes called beams due to their optical nature, are mathematically intersected to produce the three-dimensional coordinates of points of interest.</p>
    <p>Triangulation is also the principle used by theodolites for measuring coordinates. Crime scene investigators familiar with these tools will find many similarities and some differences between photogrammetry and theodolites. Triangulation is also how two human eyes work together to measure distance, called depth perception.</p>
